# 1758. Minimum Changes to Make Altering Binary String

You are given a string s consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. In one operation, you can change any '0' to '1' or vice versa.

The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal. For example, the string "010" is alternating, while the string "0100" is not.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make s alternating.


## Example 1:

    Input: s = "0100"
    Output: 1
    Explanation: If you change the last character to '1', s will be "0101", which is alternating.


## Example 2:

    Input: s = "10"
    Output: 0
    Explanation: s is already alternating.


## Example 3:

    Input: s = "1111"
    Output: 2
    Explanation: You need two operations to reach "0101" or "1010".
 

## Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 104
    s[i] is either '0' or '1'.



## Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
We've to find the minimum number of operations required to make a string alternate b/w '0' and '1', starting with '0' or '1'. 
The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal.


## Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
### 1. Iterate through the string:
For each char, determine the expected char based on its index (even indices should be '0', odd indices should be '1').

If the actual char doesn't match with the expected char, increment a counter (cnt) to track the mismatches

### 2. Calculate the min operations
Compare **cnt** (number of mismatches) with **s.length() - cnt** (number of characters that would need to be flipped if the mismatches were considered the correct pattern)

Return the min of these two values, as it represents the least number of operations needed to achieve either possible alternating pattern


## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is bcz the code iterates through the string once, performing constant-time operations within the loop.

- Space complexity: O(1)
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
O(1), as the code uses a constant amount of extra space to store variables like cnt, expectedChar, and loop counters, regardless of the input string's length.


## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(String s) {
        int cnt = 0;

        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            char expectedChar = (i % 2 == 0) ? '0' : '1';

            if(s.charAt(i) != expectedChar){
                cnt++;
            }
        }

        return Math.min(cnt, s.length() - cnt);
    }
}
```
