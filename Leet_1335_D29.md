# 1335. Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule

You want to schedule a list of jobs in d days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the ith job, you have to finish all the jobs j where 0 <= j < i).

You have to finish at least one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the d days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done on that day.

You are given an integer array jobDifficulty and an integer d. The difficulty of the ith job is jobDifficulty[i].

Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return -1.


## Example 1:

    Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2
    Output: 7
    Explanation: First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6.
    Second day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.
    The difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7 


## Example 2:

    Input: jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4
    Output: -1
    Explanation: If you finish a job per day you will still have a free day. you cannot find a schedule for the given jobs.


## Example 3:

    Input: jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The schedule is one job per day. total difficulty will be 3.
 

## Constraints:

    1 <= jobDifficulty.length <= 300
    0 <= jobDifficulty[i] <= 1000
    1 <= d <= 10



```java
class Solution {
    public int minDifficulty(int[] jobDifficulty, int d) {
        int len = jobDifficulty.length;

        if(d > len) return -1;

        int[][] minDifficulty = new int[d][len];
        for(int i = 1; i < d; i++){
            Arrays.fill(minDifficulty[i], Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        }

        int maxDifficulty = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i <= len - d; i++){
            maxDifficulty = Math.max(maxDifficulty, jobDifficulty[i]);
            minDifficulty[0][i] = maxDifficulty;
        }

        for(int day = 1; day < d; day++){

            for(int to = day; to <= len - d + day; to++){
                int currDayDifficulty = jobDifficulty[to];
                int res = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

                for(int j = to - 1; j >= day - 1; j--){
                    res = Math.min(res, minDifficulty[day - 1][j] + currDayDifficulty);
                    currDayDifficulty = Math.max(currDayDifficulty, jobDifficulty[j]);
                }

                minDifficulty[day][to] = res;
            }
        }

        return minDifficulty[d - 1][len - 1];
    }
}
