# 1496. Path Crossing

Given a string path, where path[i] = 'N', 'S', 'E' or 'W', each representing moving one unit north, south, east, or west, respectively. You start at the origin (0, 0) on a 2D plane and walk on the path specified by path.

Return true if the path crosses itself at any point, that is, if at any time you are on a location you have previously visited. Return false otherwise.


## Example 1:

    Input: path = "NES"
    Output: false 
    Explanation: Notice that the path doesn't cross any point more than once.


## Example 2:

    Input: path = "NESWW"
    Output: true
    Explanation: Notice that the path visits the origin twice.
 

## Constraints:

    1 <= path.length <= 104
    path[i] is either 'N', 'S', 'E', or 'W'.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPathCrossing(String path) {
        Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();

        int x = 0, y = 0;
        set.add("(0,0)");

        for(char ch : path.toCharArray()){
            switch(ch){
                case 'N':
                    y++;
                    break;

                case 'S':
                    y--;
                    break;

                case 'E':
                    x++;
                    break;

                case 'W':
                    x--;
                    break;
            }
            
            String cordinates = getCordinates(x, y);

            if(set.contains(cordinates)){
                return true;
            } else {
                set.add(cordinates);
            }
        }

        return false;
    }

    public String getCordinates(int x, int y) {
        return String.format("(%s,%s)", x, y);
    }

    /*
    Time Complexity: O(n)

    -> The primary loop iterates through each character of the path string, which takes O(n) time.
    -> Operations within the loop (string creation, set operations) take constant time on average.


    Space Complexity: O(m), where m is the maximum path length possible

    -> The set stores visited coordinates, potentially holding up to m unique coordinates.
    -> Other variables (strings, integers) use constant space.
    -> In the worst-case scenario, the path could visit all possible coordinates, leading to a space complexity of O(m).
